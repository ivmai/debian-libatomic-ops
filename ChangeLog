	* My bad.  I was not paying attention.  All of Ian's changes
	  from the non-native-branch are indeed useful -- if you use
	  them properly (which I did not in the entry below).  Merged
	  in the non-native branch properly, this time.

	* Makefile.am: deb target not needed (put invocation of
	  autogen.sh in debian/rules instead)

2004-08-27  Ian Wienand  <ianw@gelato.unsw.edu.au>

	* Makefile.am : add deb target, remove debian directory
	* configure.in : don't include /debian in make dist
	* debian/Makefile.am : remove
	* debian/rules : simplify for non-native package changes

2004-02-05  Ian Wienand  <ianw@gelato.unsw.edu.au>

	* everything: put into autoconf
