Source: libatomic-ops
Priority: optional
Maintainer: Ian Wienand <ianw@gelato.unsw.edu.au>
Uploaders: Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>
Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 4.0.0)
Standards-Version: 3.6.2

Package: libatomic-ops
Section: libdevel
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Architecture: any
Description: A library for atomic operations (static library only)
 Libatomic-ops implements a large collection of operations, each one
 of which is a combination of an (optional) atomic memory operation,
 and a memory barrier.  It also implements associated feature-test
 macros that determine whether a particular operation is available
 on the current target hardware (either directly or by synthesis).
 Libatomic-ops attempts to replace various existing files with similar
 goals, since they usually do not handle differences in memory barrier
 styles with sufficient generality.
 .
 This package provides only the statically linked archive; header files
 needed by developers are in 'libatomic-ops-dev' in accordance with
 Debian policy.
