libatomic-ops (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closes: bug#307503 -- FTBS.  Update to upstream 1.0 (ianw)
  * The 'libatomic-ops' package now contains only a statically linked
    library, as upstream wishes (which makes sense, in this case, and
    still fits within policy).  The 'libatomic-ops-dev' package now 
    depends on the 'libatomic-ops' as a result to ensure a developer 
    can still properly link against the package (ahs3).
  * Update standards version to 3.6.2 (ahs3)
  * Closes: bug#307448 -- variable 'ret' undefined on ARM.  I think
    this has been solved but I could be wrong and may have to reopen
    this bug (ahs3).

libatomic-ops (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge in Ian's changes for a non-native Debian package -- properly,
    this time.
  * Remove the auto* build-deps (the point of Ian's changes)
  * Closes: bug#270013 -- FTBFS: Permission problem on autogen.sh
  * Since we've started branching from upstream a little, change
    the versioning to reflect that -- hence, 0.5.1 to start with.
