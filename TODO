FIXME tasks
===========

Linux/x86 + GCC v4.6.1: make check (test_stack) fails.
This looks to be a bug in GCC (the problem is with the inlined code of
AO_compare_double_and_swap_double_full in AO_stack_pop_acquire in PIC mode).

iPhone 3GS + GCC v4.2.1 (based on Apple build 5555): test_atomic fails:
Illegal instruction.

iPhone 3GS + GCC v4.2.1: test_stack fails: Bus error.
